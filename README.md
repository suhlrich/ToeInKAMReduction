Dataset and code for lasso regression model that identifies kinematic changes related to reductions in the knee adduction moment when adopting a toe-in gait modification. One hundred seven individuals with medial knee osteoarthritis walked naturally and with 10Â° toe-in. We identified 

## Running code


## Feature Identification
The features in the X_TIdiff matrix are in the following order. Details on how these covariates were computed can be found in the manuscript.
1) trunk sway angle (max during stance)
2) knee flexion angle (at time of first peak KAM)
3) pelvic list angle (at time of first peak KAM)
